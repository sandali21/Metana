## Job Application Form

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Description
The **Job Application Processing App** is a web-based system that automates job application handling. It allows applicants to submit their details and upload CVs, which are then stored in **AWS S3**. The app extracts key information (education, qualifications, projects) from the CV and saves it to **Google Sheets**. A **webhook notification** sends the processed data to an external API, and a **follow-up email** is sent to applicants the next day. This solution streamlines recruitment by reducing manual effort and ensuring efficient applicant tracking.
